# Heartbeat Classification using Deep Neural Networks

## Description

This project is dedicated to the classification of heartbeat signals using deep learning architectures. The data for this project is derived from the famous arrhythmia dataset available on [KAGGLE](https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat).

The dataset contains electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeat patterns representing both normal and various arrhythmic conditions, as well as myocardial infarction. These signals have been preprocessed, segmented, and each segment corresponds to a heartbeat. The primary aim is to utilize deep neural networks to classify these heartbeat signals and further explore transfer learning capabilities.

## Features

- Utilization of a large dataset sufficient to train deep learning models.
- Exploration of heartbeat classification through deep neural networks.
- Study of transfer learning capabilities in the context of heartbeat classification.

## Prerequisites
